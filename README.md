>*"Most theoretical monetary economists, even those who specialised in Foreign Exchanges, made
>relatively little use of the lessons taught by earlier periods of Foreign Exchange history. It is
>no wonder that practical experts responsible for devising and executing Foreign Exchange policies
>so often failed to benefit by the lessons of the past. Much theoretical knowledge and practical
